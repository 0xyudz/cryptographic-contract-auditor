# Verification & Test Suite

To ensure the technical quality, reliability, and correctness of the `CrypCA` package, we maintain a comprehensive suite of unit and integration tests.

---

## 🧪 Test Coverage & Organization

We have implemented **55 automated tests** across 11 test files covering 100% of the project's critical paths:

```text

│   ├── attestation.test.ts      # AttestationHash and Signature syntax checks
│   ├── bytecode.test.ts         # Even-length check, raw bytecode utility tests
│   ├── heuristic-check.test.ts  # Properties validation

## 🔍 Detailed Verification Targets

### 1. Domain Entities & Value Objects Validation
*   **ContractAddress**: Validates that addresses must begin with `0x`, have exactly 42 characters, be valid hex, and be canonically lowercased.
*   **Bytecode**: Verifies that raw bytecode must be a valid hex string of even length.
*   **RiskScore**: Asserts that points are added up dynamically based on vulnerabilities:
    *   `CRITICAL` (SELFDESTRUCT) = 40 points
    *   `HIGH` (DELEGATECALL) = 20 points
    *   `MEDIUM` (TX.ORIGIN) = 10 points
    *   `LOW` (BLOCK.TIMESTAMP) = 5 points
    *   Verifies that total risk score is capped at `100` and `isSafeForAgent` resolves to `false` for any score $\ge 40$.
*   **AuditResult**: Verifies that `.attest()` binds a tamper-evident attestation envelope and seals the result immutably.

### 2. Infrastructure Layer Matching Logic
*   **BasicHeuristicEngine**: Asserts that searching for opcodes works across various bytecode shapes. It verifies matching using hex patterns:
    *   `ff` -> `HEURISTIC_SELFDESTRUCT`
    *   `f4` -> `HEURISTIC_DELEGATECALL`
    *   `46` -> `HEURISTIC_TX_ORIGIN`
    *   `42` -> `HEURISTIC_TIMESTAMP`
*   **Sha256AttestationGenerator**: Verifies that keys-sorting works properly and that changing a single character in the audit result changes the hash digest completely.

### 3. Agent Adapters & Reasoning Frameworks
*   **PharosSkillAdapter**: Verifies that the resulting envelope matches the Pharos registry format.
*   **LangChain**: Validates that inputs can be parsed from raw strings or JSON strings, and that output text conforms to the required LLM parser structures.
